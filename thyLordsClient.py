Greetings, sire! Tis I, your lowly programming knave! As you requested, this program uses an API to search for a term in a 
specific API, and give you data as such. This seems quite important to the rule of a kingdom, and I am thusly honored by 
your holiest of opportunities to have embarked on this jovial journey!
